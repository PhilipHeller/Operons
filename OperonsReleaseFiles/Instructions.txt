INSTALLATION:

1)	Un-jar the jar file.
2)	Create an Eclipse workspace.
3)	Create a Java project called “operonsproj” in the workspace.
4)	Drag and drop the "data" directory onto “operonsproj” in the Package Explorer.
5)	In the "src" subdir, select both "operons" and "weka", and drag/drop them onto "src" in the
	Package Explorer. A number of WEKA packages will be marked with red flags to indicate they
	contain compiler errors. The errors won't cause problems, as they are all in code that isn't used.



DATA:

The "data" dir in Eclipse must contain 4 files: 

1)	The GenBank nucleotide record for the genome of the organism being analyzed. For the study
	described in the article, this release includes data/AADV02.1.gbff (Crocosphaera watsonii 
	WH8501), downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AADV02000001.

2)	Time-series expression data, in comma-separated values (CSV) format. For the study described
	in the article, this release includes data/Shi_Croco.csv; this is the data set from reference 
	26 in the article (Shi et al. 2010). The file was downloaded from the ISME Journal website at
	https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2009148#MOESM4. (Supplementary Table S2.)

3)	A descriptor file that specifies the structure of the expression data file. The descriptor 
	must be in tab-separated values (TSV) format. The first line should say, “SKIP<tab>N”, where 
	N is the number of header and blank lines to be skipped at the start of the time-series file. 
	Each remaining line should describe one time point of the study. The format is 
	“Column#<tab>hours”, where “hours” gives the number of elapsed hours at the time point. For 
	example, in the Crocosphaera CSV file, column 7 gives expression measurement at the 3-hour 
	time point, so its line is “7<tab>3”. For the study described in the article, this release 
	includes data/Croco_columns.tsv.

4)	Operon predictions for the organism under study. Browse to the list of organism links at
	http://www.microbesonline.org/operons/OperonList.html, click on the desired organism, then
	click the link "A tab-delimited version of this table". Copy the result to a file in data.
	For the study described in the article, select Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501.



EXECUTION:

1)	Edit the main() method at the bottom of Experiment.java. Change lines 829-842 to specify your 
	4 data files. For the study described in the article, you just need to edit line 842, which 
	specifies the name of the operon predictions file.

2) 	Following the instructions in the comments in lines 911-919, add a few lines of code to 
	evaluate WEKA's classifiers, to classify merge candidates using an LMT model, or to classify 	
	merge candidates using any desired WEKA model.

3)	Execute the Experiment class as a Java application.
